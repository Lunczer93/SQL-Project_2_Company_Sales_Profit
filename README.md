# SQL-Projects_2 Sales and Profit Company

1.	INTRODUCTION

I was asked to analyze data that contains the information about the companyâ€™s products regarding Profit, Sales, Customers, Segment, Ship and Location in 2014-2017 years.  
I am interested in details about this period for these areas, so if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also. 
To analyze this data, I used Windows functions in SQL Server 

2.	ANALYSIS

The main task is to calculate which products, locations, customers and regions that generate the greatest and smallest amount of profit and sales.  

I calculated the quantity of products and their segments and their regions based on the type of the ship.

Furthermore, I calculated the quantity of customers and their regions, where products were delivered there.

Then, an in-depth analysis was performed such as the statistical description, the cumulative distribution and the percentile rank of Sales of Category by Customer and by Product and Sales by City. 

The ranking of customers by Sales and the ranking of Sales and Profit by Products were also performed.

Then, the classification of Customers and Products by three groups based on Sales and Profit was found.

Last but not least, the running difference of Sales Amount by months was calculated. 

The analysis of Sales and Profit by month in 2014-2017 was also performed for selected categories

The whole steps of my analysis were described in my project.
