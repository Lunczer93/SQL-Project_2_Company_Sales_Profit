# SQL-Projects_2

I was asked to analyze data that possesses the information about the companyâ€™s products regarding Profit, Sales, Customers, Segment, Ship and Location in 2014-2017 years.  

I am interested in details about this period for these areas, so if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also. 
To analyze this data, I used Windows functions in SQL Server 

The main task is to calculate which products, locations, customers and regions that generate the largest and smallest amount of profit and sales.
I also calculated the quantity of products and their segments.
Furthermore, I calculated the quantity of customers and their regions, where products were delivered there.

The whole steps of my analysis were described in my project.
